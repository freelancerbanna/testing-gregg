<h4>Salesforce Segment Mapping
</h4>

<p> Which Salesforce field do you want to use to map to iCMO
    segments? iCMO will try to map Salesforce data off of the Lead table, pivoting off of a single
    field which you will select below.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Opportunities with no leads
    </b>
    <br>If you have
    Opportunities which have no leads associated with them you may also specify optional fields on
    both the opportunity and account tables to use as a fallback. iCMO will first try the lead
    field, then the opportunity field, then the account field. If a value cannot be found in any of
    those fields then iCMO will mark the contact as 'Unknown'.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Mapping Types
    </b>
    <br>
    iCMO is capable of mapping fields in two different ways:
<p>
    <i>Text Match:
    </i> if the field is
    a text field (ex: 'Industry') then iCMO will enable you to map a specific value in that field
    (ex: 'Healthcare') to a specific iCMO Segment.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Numeric:
    </i> alternately if the
    field is numeric (ex: 'AnnualRevenue') iCMO will enable you to map the field to a specific iCMO
    segment based on whether it is greater than or equal to a specific value (ex: '>10,000,000').

</p>
<b>All selected fields must be of the same type, text or or numeric.
</b>
<h4>Campaign
    Mapping
</h4>
<p> Which Salesforce field do you want to use to map to iCMO campaigns? iCMO will
    first try to map iCMO Campaigns based off of a field you select from the Lead table.
</p>
<p>

    <b>Opportunities with no leads
    </b>
    <br> If you have Opportunities which have no leads associated
    with them you may also specify optional fields on the opportunity and account tables to use as
    a fallback. iCMO will first try the lead field, then the opportunity field, then the account
    field.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Lead Source Fallback
    </b>
    <br> If you would like, iCMO can use the standard
    Salesforce Lead Source field found on both the Lead and Opportunity tables as a fallback in
    case the other methods do not find a source.
